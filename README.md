Several genome-scale metabolic reconstruction (GSMR) tools have been developed in the last decades. These tools have helped to construct many metabolic models, which had contributed to a variety of fields, e.g., genetic engineering, drug discovery, prediction of phenotypes, and other model-driven discoveries. However, the use of these tools requires a high level of programming capabilities. Multiple steps need to be accounted for, before the generation of a functional model able to produce predictions. Another limitation is the lack of a visualization module, something that can contribute to the understanding of the metabolic network. Therefore, there is a scarcity of user-friendly tools that can be used in daily routine, providing insights about the metabolic network of a target organism for researcherâ€™s groups.

Here we present a novel tool, Chimera, which combines the most efficient tools in model reconstruction, prediction, and visualization and also implements new in-house algorithms for database integration and data manipulation. 

## Our aim with Chimera

- Produce an organism-specific model based on the CarveMe algorithm 

- Manage the model and perform growth predictions with COBRApy 

- Create visualization for the metabolic network using PSAMM and Escher 

- Add pathway information to metabolic maps using in house algorithm 

- Perform single and double, gene and reaction, knockout in the organism 


All of that is obtained through automation and connection of the most used tools in the literature, creating a pipeline that is easy to use, helping those researchers with none or small programming capabilities.


## Detail about the scripts

You must download the folder or the git repository. In the folder there are 3 scripts, one extra folder and 2 txt files with the dependencies to install

```
chimera_core.py: perform the model creation evaluation and visualization files

path_harvest.py: is used to add KEGG pathway description in the genome-scale metabolic map

simulating_knockouts.py: is used to perform gene and reactions knockout

all_metabo_paths: a folder containing pre-defined metabolic maps for a general overview of the pathways present in the target organism
```

### Installation

Verify if you have anaconda intalled in you machine. The tool can be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

Before installing you need to install CPLEX solver from IMB. Click [here](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/datascience/blogs/xavier-nodet1/2020/07/09/cplex-free-for-students) to access the academic license. This documentation was created with `IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio V20.10`.

After download, follow the required system installation. For Linux, make sure to export your installation path

```
export PATH=/PATH_TO_CPLEX/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/:$PATH
```
Obs: The command above will export the installation path of cplex to $PATH shell variable. Pay attention during the installation procedure, it will ask you where to install cplex (<PATH_TO_CPLEX>)

Install the conda env

There are 2 envs, use the one that suits you better:

environment.yml for mac
environment_linux.yml for linux


```
conda env create -f <environment.yml>
# activate the environment
conda activate chimera
```
Alternative intall
```
__Creating env__
conda create --name chimera python=3.7
conda activate chimera
__Install dependencies__
conda install pip
conda install -c bioconda diamond
pip install carveme
pip install cobra
pip install escher
pip install git+https://github.com/zhanglab/psamm-import.git
conda install -c conda-forge biopython
conda install -c conda-forge bioservices

```

Navigate to `python cplex` the installation folder:

```
cd /PATH_TO_CPLEX/cplex/python/3.7/x86-64_linux/
```

And then install

```
python setup.py install
```
_OBS_: If you have troubles installing the API, check : https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/icos/12.8.0.0?topic=cplex-setting-up-python-api .

_OBS_: Some users reported an error during the installation of the API.  "Unknown distribution option: zip_fafe. Could not create build: permission denied".

To solve, instead the command above, use:

```
python setup.py build -b /home_directory/
```
Or, you can follow [this tutorial](https://askubuntu.com/questions/263450/folders-showing-lock-icon).


## Update

If a new library needs to be installed, don't forget to update the environment.yml file

```
conda env export | grep -v "^prefix: " > environment.yml
```

## Usage

Before using, activate the conda env

```
conda activate chimera
```
__Intended usage__: You should have a folder with the 3 main scripts, the all_metado_paths folder and a faa file for your organism. 

### To access the help page:

```
python chimera_core.py -h
```

### To run the test on model  __Escherichia coli__:

```
python chimera_core.py input_examples/faa_file/e_coli_test.faa gramneg LB LB
```
You can also use a pre-buit model, overstaping the model creation, directly producing FBA predictions and Visualization. You just need to have .xml model in your folder, with the same prefix as your faa file. In our example that would be __e_coli_test.xml__.

The same command is used in this case.
```
# (THIS COMMAND SHOULD CREATE A PSAMM FOLDER? DID NOT WORK FOR ME)
python chimera_core.py e_coli_test.faa gramneg LB LB
```
Due to annotation discrepacies cytoscape compatible file may fail to be created. This is due to id missmatch of the provided model.
If you still want to perform the graph creation, inside psamm folder type the following code:

```
psamm-model vis --method no-fpp
```

### To perfom pathway annotation using KEGG as reference to the Cytoscape maps we can use:

We need the previous step to be executed before running this module.

```
python path_harvest.py
```
This command will annotate the pathway for the compounds in the metabolic map. This command can take a while.



### To perform gene or reaction knockout we can use on the model __Escherichia coli__:
All commands will request the name of the model you want to use as target. For example e_coli_test.xml, which need to be in the main folder.

**For specific genes**

Single gene deletion for all genes in the knockout_genes_list.txt:

```
# IS THIS THE CORRECT PRINTING FORMAT:
# <<<Complete model>>>:  <Solution 4.830 at 0x7f9017497790>
# trkA knocked out:  <Solution 4.830 at 0x7f9017497d10>
# IS THIS EASY TO INTERPRET?
python simulating_knockouts.py --sg e_coli_test.faa input_examples/reations_gene_to_delete/knockout_genes_list.txt
```
Double gene deletion for all genes in the knockout_genes_list.txt:

```
python simulating_knockouts.py --dg e_coli_test.faa input_examples/reations_gene_to_delete/knockout_genes_list.txt
```

**For specific reactions**

Single reaction deletion for all reactions in the knockout_reactions_list.txt:

```
python simulating_knockouts.py --sr e_coli_test.faa input_examples/reations_gene_to_delete/knockout_reactions_list.txt
```
Double reaction deletion for all reactions in the knockout_reactions_list.txt:

```
python simulating_knockouts.py --dr e_coli_test.faa input_examples/reations_gene_to_delete/knockout_reactions_list.txt
```
Specifc Double reaction deletion. Here we only evaluate the first 2 reactions in  knockout_reactions_list.txt:

```
python simulating_knockouts.py --tdr e_coli_test.faa input_examples/reations_gene_to_delete/knockout_reactions_list.txt
```
**Gene and reaction essenciality**

Here we evaluate the individual impact in growth due to a single gene or reaction in the model.

To evaluate gene essenciality:

```
# IS THIS THE CORRECT PRINTING FORMAT:
# 1678,{'G_lcl_NZ_CP027599_1_prot_WP_001315111_1_5786'},4.8299,optimal
python simulating_knockouts.py --cg
# WHY THE {} IN THE OUT?
```
To evaluate reaction essenciality:

```
python simulating_knockouts.py --cr
```
